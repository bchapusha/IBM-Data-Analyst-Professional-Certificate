### ðŸŸ¦ Introduction

For this project, you will be working on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. You have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. You will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.

### ðŸŸ¦ Analysis

#### âšª Access SQL Databases through Python

For the analysis we will use Python with a database instance from SQL Server, which will allow us to query data using SQL through Python.

The following code load the sql module and connects to a database instance

```
%load_ext sql
%sql mssql+pyodbc://sa:****@SQLMain
```

#### âšª Answering Questions About The Data

##### 1. Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.

```
%%sql

SELECT COUNT(CASE_NUMBER) AS 'Number of Recorded Crimes'
FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA;
```

##### 2. List community areas with per capita income less than 11000.

```
%%sql

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME AS 'Community Areas with per capita < 11000'
FROM CENSUS_DATA
WHERE PER_CAPITA_INCOME < 11000
ORDER BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME;
```

<img src="images/question2.jpg" width="1100">

##### 3. List all case numbers for crimes involving minors?

```
%%sql

SELECT CASE_NUMBER 'Case Numbers Involving Minors'
FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
WHERE DESCRIPTION LIKE '%MINOR%';
```

<img src="images/question3.jpg" width="1100">

##### 4. List all kidnapping crimes involving a child?(children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)

```
%%sql

SELECT * 
FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
WHERE PRIMARY_TYPE = 'KIDNAPPING';
```

<img src="images/question4.jpg" width="1100">

##### 5. What kind of crimes were recorded at schools?

```
%%sql

SELECT DISTINCT(PRIMARY_TYPE) AS 'Crimes Recorded at Schools'
FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
WHERE LOCATION_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%SCHOOL%';
```

<img src="images/question5.jpg" width="1100">

##### 6. List the average safety score for all types of schools.

```
%%sql

SELECT Elementary_Middle_or_High_School AS 'Type of School', AVG(SAFETY_SCORE) AS 'Average Safety Score'
FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
GROUP BY Elementary_Middle_or_High_School;
```

<img src="images/question6.jpg" width="1100">

##### 7. List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line.

```
%%sql

SELECT TOP 5 COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME AS 'Community Area', 
           CONVERT(DECIMAL(4,1), PERCENT_HOUSEHOLDS_BELOW_POVERTY) AS '% Households Below Poverty Line'
FROM CENSUS_DATA
ORDER BY PERCENT_HOUSEHOLDS_BELOW_POVERTY DESC;
```

<img src="images/question7.jpg" width="1100">

##### 8. Which community area(number) is most crime prone?

```
%%sql

SELECT TOP 1 CENSUS_DATA.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME AS 'Community Area', 
             COUNT(CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER) AS 'Number of Crimes'
FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
INNER JOIN CENSUS_DATA
ON CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = CENSUS_DATA.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER 
GROUP BY CENSUS_DATA.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME
ORDER BY COUNT(CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER) DESC;
```

<img src="images/question8.jpg" width="1100">

##### 9. Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with highest hardship index.

```
%%sql

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME AS 'Community Area with Highest Hardship Index'
FROM CENSUS_DATA
WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX = (SELECT MAX(HARDSHIP_INDEX) FROM CENSUS_DATA);
```

<img src="images/question9.jpg" width="1100">

##### 10. Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with most number of crimes?

```
%%sql

SELECT TOP 1 COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME AS 'Community Area with Most Crimes'
FROM CENSUS_DATA
WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = (SELECT TOP 1 COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER 
                               FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA 
                               GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER 
                               ORDER BY COUNT(COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER) DESC);
```
