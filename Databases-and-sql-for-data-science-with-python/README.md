### ðŸŸ¦ Introduction

For this project, you will be working on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. You have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. You will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.

### ðŸŸ¦ Analysis

For the analysis we will use Python with a database instance from SQL Server, which will allow us to query data using SQL through Python.

#### âšª Answering Questions About The Data
