### 🟦 Part 1: Creating Visualizations Using Excel

#### Context

As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to create some visualizations to allow you to understand your car sales and profits for each dealer.

#### Tasks to Perform

Create visualizations for the following:

1. **‘Quantity Sold’ by ‘Dealer ID’** - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to “Quantity Sold by Dealer ID” (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet1, and use ‘Format’ on the ‘Chart’ tab to change the chart title)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/profit-by-date-and-model.png" width="700">
</p>

2. **‘Profit’ by ‘Date’ and ‘Model’** - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of “Profit by Date and Model” (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet2, and use ‘Chart Title’ on the ‘Chart’ tab to change the chart title)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/profit-by-year-and-dealer-id.png" width="700">
</p>

3. **‘Profit’ by ‘Year’ and ‘Dealer ID’** - as a column chart, titled “Profit by Year and Dealer ID” with the data columns in red (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet3, and use ‘Format’ on the ‘Chart’ tab to change the chart title and to format the ‘series’ fill color in red)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/profit-of-hudson-models-by-dealer-id.png" width="700">
</p>

4. **‘Sum of Profits’ for ‘Hudson model cars’ by ‘Dealer ID’** - as a line chart, titled “Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID”. Also remove the horizontal gridlines from the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green. (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet4, use ‘Gridlines’ in the ‘Axes’ group on the ‘Chart’ tab to remove the gridlines, and use ‘Format’ on the ‘Chart’ tab to change the chart title, to move the legend, and to format the ‘series’ outline color in green)
